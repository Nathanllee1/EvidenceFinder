In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power. \n",

      "Quote:  Daughter of Leda, guardian of my home, your speech was, like my absence, far too long. Praise that’s due to us should come from others. Then it’s worthwhile. All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man. Thus, if I act, in every circumstance, as I ought to now, there’s nothing I need fear.\n",

And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power. \n",

All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man.

That was what I’d never known before—and it’s better than anything I’ve known.... I can’t go back now to that other way of thinking. I can’t love you unless I give you up.\n",

And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power. \n",

All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man. Thus, if I act, in every circumstance, as I ought to now, there’s nothing I need fear.\n",

And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power. \n",

All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man. Thus, if I act, in every circumstance, as I ought to now, there’s nothing I need fear.\n",

I am no longer a shuddering speck of existence, alone in the darkness;—I belong to them and they to me; we all share the same fear and the same life, we are nearer than lovers, in a simpler, a harder way; I could bury my face in them, in these voices, these words that have saved me and will stand by me. \n",

And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power. \n",

All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man.

And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt.

All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man.

Good alone Is good without a name. Vileness is so: The property by what it is should go, Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair; In these to nature she's immediate heir, And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn, Which challenges itself as honour's born And is not like the sire: honours thrive, When rather from our acts we them derive Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb Of honour'd bones indeed.
