3	So we passed, hand-cuffed and in silence, through the streets of Washington—though the Capital of a nation, whose theory of government, we are told, rests on the foundation of man’s inalienable right to life, LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness! Hail! Columbia, happy land indeed! 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
4	My cup of sorrow was full to overflowing. Then I lifted up my hands to God, and in the still watches of the night […] begged for mercy on the poor, forsaken captive.

5	He would make us hold up our heads, walk briskly back and forth, while customers would feel of our hands and arms and bodies, turn us about, ask us what we could do, make us open our mouths and show our teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. 	"[""racism-and-slavery""]"
6	The influences and associations that had always surrounded him, blinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery. He never doubted the moral right of one man holding another in subjection. Looking through the same medium with his fathers before him, he saw things in the same light.

8	I must toil day after day, endure abuse and taunts and scoffs, sleep on the hard ground, live on the coarsest fare, and not only this, but live the slave of a blood-seeking wretch, of whom I must stand henceforth in continued fear and dread.

10	The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature.

290	Thus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever unusual—nothing but the common hopes, and loves, and labors of an obscure colored man, making his humble progress in the world […] Now I had approached within the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.

291	The idea struck me as a prudent one, though I think it would scarcely have occurred to me, had they not proposed it […] I must confess, that the papers were scarcely worth the cost of obtaining them—the apprehension of danger to my personal safety never having suggested itself to me in the remotest manner.

296	The influences and associations that had always surrounded him, blinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery.

300	The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature. Daily witnesses of human suffering—listening to the agonizing screeches of the human slave—beholding him writhing beneath the merciless lash—bitten and torn by dogs—dying without attention, and buried without shroud or coffin—it cannot otherwise be expected, than that they should become brutified and reckless of human life.

301	Alas! Had it not been for my beloved violin, I scarcely can conceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage. It […] relieved me of many days’ labor in the field […] and oftentimes led me away from the presence of a hard master.

302	No man who has never been placed in such a situation, can comprehend the thousand obstacles thrown in the way of the flying slave.

303	It was the Sabbath of the Lord. The fields smiled in the warm sunlight—the birds chirped merrily amidst the foliage of the trees—peace and happiness seemed to reign everywhere, save in the bosoms of Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses around him. The tempestuous emotions that were raging there were little in harmony with the calm and quiet beauty of the day. I could look on Epps only with unutterable loathing and abhorrence, and thought within myself—“Thou devil, sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!”	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
304	If they are baboons, or stand no higher in the scale of intelligence than such animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. There’s a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet—yes, Epps, there’s a day coming that will burn as an oven. It may be sooner or it may be later, but it’s a coming as sure as the Lord is just. 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
305	The secret was out—the mystery was unraveled. Through the thick, black cloud, amid whose dark and dismal shadows I had walked twelve years, broke the star that was to light me back to liberty.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
306	I was then offered as a witness, but, objection being made, the court decided my evidence inadmissible. It was rejected solely on the ground that I was a colored man—the fact of my being a free citizen of New-York not being disputed. […] Burch himself was offered as a witness in his own behalf. It was contended by counsel for the people, that such testimony should not be allowed—that it was in contravention of every rule of evidence, and if permitted would defeat the ends of justice. His testimony, however, was received by the court!	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"

348	I went and told the Widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” This was too much for me, but she told me what she means—I must help others, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself…but I couldn’t see no advantage about it—except for the other people—so at last I reckoned I wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go.

356	Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom.

365	Thus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever unusual—nothing but the common hopes, and loves, and labors of an obscure colored man, making his humble progress in the world […] Now I had approached within the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""family""]"
366	The idea struck me as a prudent one, though I think it would scarcely have occurred to me, had they not proposed it […] I must confess, that the papers were scarcely worth the cost of obtaining them—the apprehension of danger to my personal safety never having suggested itself to me in the remotest manner.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
367	Though suspicions of Brown and Hamilton were not unfrequent, I could not reconcile myself to the idea that they were instrumental to my imprisonment.

368	So we passed, hand-cuffed and in silence, through the streets of Washington—though the Capital of a nation, whose theory of government, we are told, rests on the foundation of man’s inalienable right to life, LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness! Hail! Columbia, happy land indeed! 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
369	My cup of sorrow was full to overflowing. Then I lifted up my hands to God, and in the still watches of the night […] begged for mercy on the poor, forsaken captive. To the Almighty Father of us all—the freeman and the slave—I poured forth the supplications of a broken spirit, imploring strength from on high to bear up against the burden of my troubles […].

370	He would make us hold up our heads, walk briskly back and forth, while customers would feel of our hands and arms and bodies, turn us about, ask us what we could do, make us open our mouths and show our teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. 	"[""racism-and-slavery""]"
371	The influences and associations that had always surrounded him, blinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery. He never doubted the moral right of one man holding another in subjection. Looking through the same medium with his fathers before him, he saw things in the same light. Brought up under other circumstances and influences, his notions would undoubtedly have been different.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""family""]"
372	He was my master, entitled by law to my flesh and blood, and to exercise over me such tyrannical control as his mean nature prompted; but there was no law that could prevent my looking upon him with intense contempt.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
373	I must toil day after day, endure abuse and taunts and scoffs, sleep on the hard ground, live on the coarsest fare, and not only this, but live the slave of a blood-seeking wretch, of whom I must stand henceforth in continued fear and dread. […] I sighed for liberty; but the bondman’s chain was round me, and could not be shaken off.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
374	Bent with excessive toil—actually suffering for a little refreshing rest, and feeling rather as if we could cast ourselves upon the earth and weep, many a night in the house of Edwin Epps have his unhappy slaves been made to dance and laugh. 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""the-power-of-music""]"
375	The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature. Daily witnesses of human suffering—listening to the agonizing screeches of the human slave—beholding him writhing beneath the merciless lash—bitten and torn by dogs—dying without attention, and buried without shroud or coffin—it cannot otherwise be expected, than that they should become brutified and reckless of human life. 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
376	Alas! Had it not been for my beloved violin, I scarcely can conceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage. It […] relieved me of many days’ labor in the field […] and oftentimes led me away from the presence of a hard master. […] It was my companion—the friend of my bosom—triumphing loudly when I was joyful, and uttering its soft, melodious consolations when I was sad. Often […] it would sing me a song of peace.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""christianity"", ""the-power-of-music""]"
377	No man who has never been placed in such a situation, can comprehend the thousand obstacles thrown in the way of the flying slave. Every white man’s hand is raised against him—the patrollers are watching for him—the hounds are ready to follow on his track—and the nature of the country is such as renders it impossible to pass through it with any safety.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
378	It was the Sabbath of the Lord. The fields smiled in the warm sunlight—the birds chirped merrily amidst the foliage of the trees—peace and happiness seemed to reign everywhere, save in the bosoms of Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses around him. The tempestuous emotions that were raging there were little in harmony with the calm and quiet beauty of the day. I could look on Epps only with unutterable loathing and abhorrence, and thought within myself—“Thou devil, sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!”	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
379	If they are baboons, or stand no higher in the scale of intelligence than such animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. There’s a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet—yes, Epps, there’s a day coming that will burn as an oven. It may be sooner or it may be later, but it’s a coming as sure as the Lord is just. 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
380	The secret was out—the mystery was unraveled. Through the thick, black cloud, amid whose dark and dismal shadows I had walked twelve years, broke the star that was to light me back to liberty.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
381	I was then offered as a witness, but, objection being made, the court decided my evidence inadmissible. It was rejected solely on the ground that I was a colored man—the fact of my being a free citizen of New-York not being disputed. […] Burch himself was offered as a witness in his own behalf. It was contended by counsel for the people, that such testimony should not be allowed—that it was in contravention of every rule of evidence, and if permitted would defeat the ends of justice. His testimony, however, was received by the court!	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"

And the tribe of Pacific Northwesterners. And the tribe of tortilla-chips-and-salsa lovers. And the tribe of poverty. And the tribe of funeral-goers. And the tribe of beloved sons.

444	My cup of sorrow was full to overflowing. Then I lifted up my hands to God, and in the still watches of the night […] begged for mercy on the poor, forsaken captive.

450	The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature.

471	“My name is Junior,” I said. “And my name is Arnold. I’m Junior and Arnold. I’m both.” I felt like two different people inside of one body.

474	Traveling between Reardan and Wellpinit, between the little white town and the reservation, I always felt like a stranger. I was half Indian in one place and half white in the other.

476	Two thousand Indians laughed at the same time. … It was the most glorious noise I’d ever heard.

And the tribe of Pacific Northwesterners. And the tribe of tortilla-chips-and-salsa lovers. And the tribe of poverty. And the tribe of funeral-goers. And the tribe of beloved sons.

488	Shit, Colin made a funny. This place is like magic for you. Shame about how we’re gonna die here, though. I mean, seriously. An Arab and a half-Jew enter a store in Tennessee. It’s the beginning of a joke, and the punchline is “sodomy.”	"[""plans-change-and-growth""]"

591	The people’s voice, once angered, can create dissent, ratifying a curse which now must have its way.  And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power.

592	 Daughter of Leda, guardian of my home, your speech was, like my absence, far too long. Praise that’s due to us should come from others. Then it’s worthwhile. All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man. Thus, if I act, in every circumstance, as I ought to now, there’s nothing I need fear.	"[""war-and-its-aftermath"", ""gender-roles"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
593	 Up there on that roof there sits a chorus— it never leaves. They sing in harmony, but the song is harsh, predicting doom.

594	 To rest unsatisfied amid great wealth is in the nature of all human beings. No one can point and order it away from princely homes by uttering the words “Dissatisfaction, enter here no more!”  Take Agamemnon. The powers in heaven permitted him to capture Priam’s town, to return home honoured by the gods. But now, if he must pay the penalty for blood which other men before him shed and die in retribution for the dead  he killed himself, what mortal human being who hears all this can boast he lives a life unscarred by fate?

595	Thus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever unusual—nothing but the common hopes, and loves, and labors of an obscure colored man, making his humble progress in the world […] Now I had approached within the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.

601	The influences and associations that had always surrounded him, blinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery.

605	The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature.

606	Alas! Had it not been for my beloved violin, I scarcely can conceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage.

608	It was the Sabbath of the Lord. The fields smiled in the warm sunlight—the birds chirped merrily amidst the foliage of the trees—peace and happiness seemed to reign everywhere, save in the bosoms of Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses around him. The tempestuous emotions that were raging there were little in harmony with the calm and quiet beauty of the day.

609	If they are baboons, or stand no higher in the scale of intelligence than such animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it.

611	I was then offered as a witness, but, objection being made, the court decided my evidence inadmissible. It was rejected solely on the ground that I was a colored man—the fact of my being a free citizen of New-York not being disputed. […] Burch himself was offered as a witness in his own behalf. It was contended by counsel for the people, that such testimony should not be allowed—that it was in contravention of every rule of evidence, and if permitted would defeat the ends of justice.

671	The people’s voice, once angered, can create dissent, ratifying a curse which now must have its way.  And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power.

672	 Daughter of Leda, guardian of my home, your speech was, like my absence, far too long. Praise that’s due to us should come from others. Then it’s worthwhile. All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man. Thus, if I act, in every circumstance, as I ought to now, there’s nothing I need fear.	"[""war-and-its-aftermath"", ""gender-roles"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
673	 Up there on that roof there sits a chorus— it never leaves. They sing in harmony, but the song is harsh, predicting doom.

Sitting in the home, they chant their song, the madness that began all this, each in turn cursing that man who defiled his brother’s bed. 	"[""revenge"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
674	 To rest unsatisfied amid great wealth is in the nature of all human beings. No one can point and order it away from princely homes by uttering the words “Dissatisfaction, enter here no more!”  Take Agamemnon. The powers in heaven permitted him to capture Priam’s town, to return home honoured by the gods. But now, if he must pay the penalty for blood which other men before him shed and die in retribution for the dead  he killed himself, what mortal human being who hears all this can boast he lives a life unscarred by fate?

675	...[A]n unalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the German text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be translated into Italian for the clearer understanding of English-speaking audiences. This seemed as natural to Newland Archer as all the other conventions on which his life was molded: such as the duty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue enamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a flower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole.

"[""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
677	What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a “decent” fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?... He reviewed his friends’ marriages... and saw none that answered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which he pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland. He perceived that such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the versatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefully trained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.

678	The Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as Archer scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond necklaces and towering ostrich feathers, they struck him as curiously immature compared with hers.

Mr. Letterblair tells me the financial question has been settled—”“Oh, yes,” she said indifferently.“Well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely disagreeable and painful?

681	No, it was worse a thousand times if, judging Beaufort, and probably despising him, she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an advantage over the other men about her: his habit of two continents and two societies, his familiar association with artists and actors..., and his careless contempt for local prejudices.... [T]he circumstances of his life, and a certain native shrewdness, made him better worth talking to than many men, morally and socially his betters, whose horizon was bounded by the Battery and the Central Park.

682	Traces still lingered on [her features] of fresh beauty like her daughter’s; and he asked himself if May’s face was doomed to thicken into the same middle-aged image of invincible innocence.Ah, no, he did not want May to have that kind of innocence, the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience!	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage""]"
683	I felt there was no one as kind as you; no one who gave me reasons that I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard and—unnecessary. The very good people didn’t convince me; I felt they’d never been tempted. But you knew; you understood; you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands—and yet you hated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference. That was what I’d never known before—and it’s better than anything I’ve known.... I can’t go back now to that other way of thinking. I can’t love you unless I give you up.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
684	A stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents should be “shown” had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and it seemed inconceivable to Archer that grown-up people should work themselves into a state of agitation over such trifles.... Yet there was a time when Archer had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with worldwide significance.“And all the while, I suppose,” he thought, “real people were living somewhere, and real things happening to them...”	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
685	In all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people whom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously avoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not “dignified” to force oneself on the notice of one’s acquaintances in foreign countries.Mrs. Archer and Janey... had so unflinchingly lived up to this principle... that they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a word with a “foreigner” other than those employed in hotels and railway-stations.	"[""the-rules-of-society"", ""american-vs-foreign""]"
686	His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen.... It had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to have found Madame Olenska; and she was far away, and even the pink sunshade was not hers...	"[""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""change-and-progress""]"
687	“Is it a bad business—for May?”He stood in the window... feeling in every fiber the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her cousin’s name.“For that’s the thing we’ve always got to think of—haven’t we—by your own showing?” she insisted.... “[I]f it’s not worth while to have given up, to have missed things, so that others may be saved from disillusionment and misery—then everything I came home for, everything that made my other life seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took account of them—all these things are a sham or a dream—”	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
688	[P]unctually at about this time Mrs. Archer always said that New York was very much changed.Observing it from the lofty stand-point of a non-participant, she was able... to trace each new crack in its surface, and all the strange weeds pushing up between the ordered rows of social vegetables. It had been one of the amusements of Archer’s youth to... hear her enumerate the minute signs of disintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked. For New York, to Mrs. Archer’s mind, never changed without changing for the worse.... 	"[""the-rules-of-society"", ""change-and-progress""]"
689	As she sat thus, the lamplight full on her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he would always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years to come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a weakness, a cruelty or an emotion.... Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother, and mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr. Welland.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society"", ""change-and-progress""]"
690	And then it came over him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of them he and Madame Olenska were lovers.... He guessed himself to have been, for months, the center of countless silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears, he understood that, by means as yet unknown to him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife on the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined anything....It was the old New York way, of taking life “without effusion of blood”; the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed decency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more ill-bred than “scenes,” except the behavior of those who gave rise to them.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
691	And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;... generous, faithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of growth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever being conscious of the change.... And she had died thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious households like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was convinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate in Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his parents’ lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her) would transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-rules-of-society"", ""change-and-progress""]"
692	Thus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever unusual—nothing but the common hopes, and loves, and labors of an obscure colored man, making his humble progress in the world […] Now I had approached within the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""family""]"
693	The idea struck me as a prudent one, though I think it would scarcely have occurred to me, had they not proposed it […] I must confess, that the papers were scarcely worth the cost of obtaining them—the apprehension of danger to my personal safety never having suggested itself to me in the remotest manner.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
694	Though suspicions of Brown and Hamilton were not unfrequent, I could not reconcile myself to the idea that they were instrumental to my imprisonment.

695	So we passed, hand-cuffed and in silence, through the streets of Washington—though the Capital of a nation, whose theory of government, we are told, rests on the foundation of man’s inalienable right to life, LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness! Hail! Columbia, happy land indeed! 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
696	My cup of sorrow was full to overflowing. Then I lifted up my hands to God, and in the still watches of the night […] begged for mercy on the poor, forsaken captive.

697	He would make us hold up our heads, walk briskly back and forth, while customers would feel of our hands and arms and bodies, turn us about, ask us what we could do, make us open our mouths and show our teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. 	"[""racism-and-slavery""]"
698	The influences and associations that had always surrounded him, blinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery. He never doubted the moral right of one man holding another in subjection. Looking through the same medium with his fathers before him, he saw things in the same light.

700	I must toil day after day, endure abuse and taunts and scoffs, sleep on the hard ground, live on the coarsest fare, and not only this, but live the slave of a blood-seeking wretch, of whom I must stand henceforth in continued fear and dread.

702	The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature. Daily witnesses of human suffering—listening to the agonizing screeches of the human slave—beholding him writhing beneath the merciless lash—bitten and torn by dogs—dying without attention, and buried without shroud or coffin—it cannot otherwise be expected, than that they should become brutified and reckless of human life. 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
703	Alas! Had it not been for my beloved violin, I scarcely can conceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage. It […] relieved me of many days’ labor in the field […] and oftentimes led me away from the presence of a hard master. […] It was my companion—the friend of my bosom—triumphing loudly when I was joyful, and uttering its soft, melodious consolations when I was sad. Often […] it would sing me a song of peace.

704	No man who has never been placed in such a situation, can comprehend the thousand obstacles thrown in the way of the flying slave.

705	It was the Sabbath of the Lord. The fields smiled in the warm sunlight—the birds chirped merrily amidst the foliage of the trees—peace and happiness seemed to reign everywhere, save in the bosoms of Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses around him. The tempestuous emotions that were raging there were little in harmony with the calm and quiet beauty of the day. I could look on Epps only with unutterable loathing and abhorrence, and thought within myself—“Thou devil, sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!”	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
706	If they are baboons, or stand no higher in the scale of intelligence than such animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it.

708	I was then offered as a witness, but, objection being made, the court decided my evidence inadmissible. It was rejected solely on the ground that I was a colored man—the fact of my being a free citizen of New-York not being disputed. […] Burch himself was offered as a witness in his own behalf. It was contended by counsel for the people, that such testimony should not be allowed—that it was in contravention of every rule of evidence, and if permitted would defeat the ends of justice. His testimony, however, was received by the court!	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"

And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power.

769	 Daughter of Leda, guardian of my home, your speech was, like my absence, far too long. Praise that’s due to us should come from others. Then it’s worthwhile. All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man. Thus, if I act, in every circumstance, as I ought to now, there’s nothing I need fear.	"[""war-and-its-aftermath"", ""gender-roles"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
770	 Up there on that roof there sits a chorus— it never leaves. They sing in harmony, but the song is harsh, predicting doom.  Drinking human blood has made them bold— they dance in celebration through the house. The family’s Furies cannot be dislodged.  Sitting in the home, they chant their song, the madness that began all this, each in turn cursing that man who defiled his brother’s bed. 	"[""revenge"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
771	 To rest unsatisfied amid great wealth is in the nature of all human beings. No one can point and order it away from princely homes by uttering the words “Dissatisfaction, enter here no more!”  Take Agamemnon. The powers in heaven permitted him to capture Priam’s town, to return home honoured by the gods. But now, if he must pay the penalty for blood which other men before him shed and die in retribution for the dead  he killed himself, what mortal human being who hears all this can boast he lives a life unscarred by fate?

"[""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
774	What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a “decent” fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?... He reviewed his friends’ marriages... and saw none that answered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which he pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland. He perceived that such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the versatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefully trained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.

775	The Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as Archer scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond necklaces and towering ostrich feathers, they struck him as curiously immature compared with hers.

Mr. Letterblair tells me the financial question has been settled—”“Oh, yes,” she said indifferently.“Well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely disagreeable and painful?

778	No, it was worse a thousand times if, judging Beaufort, and probably despising him, she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an advantage over the other men about her: his habit of two continents and two societies, his familiar association with artists and actors..., and his careless contempt for local prejudices.... [T]he circumstances of his life, and a certain native shrewdness, made him better worth talking to than many men, morally and socially his betters, whose horizon was bounded by the Battery and the Central Park.

779	Traces still lingered on [her features] of fresh beauty like her daughter’s; and he asked himself if May’s face was doomed to thicken into the same middle-aged image of invincible innocence.Ah, no, he did not want May to have that kind of innocence, the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience!	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage""]"
780	I felt there was no one as kind as you; no one who gave me reasons that I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard and—unnecessary. The very good people didn’t convince me; I felt they’d never been tempted. But you knew; you understood; you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands—and yet you hated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference. That was what I’d never known before—and it’s better than anything I’ve known.... I can’t go back now to that other way of thinking. I can’t love you unless I give you up.

781	A stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents should be “shown” had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and it seemed inconceivable to Archer that grown-up people should work themselves into a state of agitation over such trifles.... Yet there was a time when Archer had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with worldwide significance.“And all the while, I suppose,” he thought, “real people were living somewhere, and real things happening to them...”	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
782	In all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people whom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously avoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not “dignified” to force oneself on the notice of one’s acquaintances in foreign countries.Mrs. Archer and Janey... had so unflinchingly lived up to this principle... that they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a word with a “foreigner” other than those employed in hotels and railway-stations.

783	His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen....

"[""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""change-and-progress""]"
784	“Is it a bad business—for May?”He stood in the window... feeling in every fiber the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her cousin’s name.“For that’s the thing we’ve always got to think of—haven’t we—by your own showing?” she insisted.... “[I]f it’s not worth while to have given up, to have missed things, so that others may be saved from disillusionment and misery—then everything I came home for, everything that made my other life seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took account of them—all these things are a sham or a dream—”	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
785	[P]unctually at about this time Mrs. Archer always said that New York was very much changed.Observing it from the lofty stand-point of a non-participant, she was able... to trace each new crack in its surface, and all the strange weeds pushing up between the ordered rows of social vegetables. It had been one of the amusements of Archer’s youth to... hear her enumerate the minute signs of disintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked. For New York, to Mrs. Archer’s mind, never changed without changing for the worse.... 	"[""the-rules-of-society"", ""change-and-progress""]"
786	As she sat thus, the lamplight full on her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he would always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years to come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a weakness, a cruelty or an emotion.... Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother, and mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr. Welland.

787	And then it came over him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of them he and Madame Olenska were lovers.... He guessed himself to have been, for months, the center of countless silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears, he understood that, by means as yet unknown to him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife on the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined anything....It was the old New York way, of taking life “without effusion of blood”; the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed decency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more ill-bred than “scenes,” except the behavior of those who gave rise to them.

788	And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;... generous, faithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of growth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever being conscious of the change.... And she had died thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious households like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was convinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate in Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his parents’ lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her) would transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.

791	“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy. “Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible café.

792	He thought of the many roads he had traveled, and of the strange way God had chosen to show him his treasure. If he hadn’t believed in the significance of recurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy woman, the king, the thief, or…“Well, it’s a long list. But the path was written in the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,” he said to himself.	"[""the-pursuit-of-your-personal-legend"", ""maktub-and-what-is-meant-to-be""]"
