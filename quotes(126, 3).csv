0	1	Thus far the history of my life presents nothing whatever unusual—nothing but the common hopes, and loves, and labors of an obscure colored man, making his humble progress in the world […] Now I had approached within the shadow of the cloud, into the thick darkness whereof I was soon to disappear, thenceforward to be hidden from the eyes of all my kindred, and shut out from the sweet light of liberty, for many a weary year.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""family""]"
1	1	The idea struck me as a prudent one, though I think it would scarcely have occurred to me, had they not proposed it […] I must confess, that the papers were scarcely worth the cost of obtaining them—the apprehension of danger to my personal safety never having suggested itself to me in the remotest manner.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
2	1	Though suspicions of Brown and Hamilton were not unfrequent, I could not reconcile myself to the idea that they were instrumental to my imprisonment. Surely they would seek me out—they would deliver me from thraldom. Alas! I had not then learned the measure “man’s inhumanity to man,” nor to what limitless extent of wickedness he will go for the love of gain.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
3	1	So we passed, hand-cuffed and in silence, through the streets of Washington—though the Capital of a nation, whose theory of government, we are told, rests on the foundation of man’s inalienable right to life, LIBERTY, and the pursuit of happiness! Hail! Columbia, happy land indeed! 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
4	1	My cup of sorrow was full to overflowing. Then I lifted up my hands to God, and in the still watches of the night […] begged for mercy on the poor, forsaken captive. To the Almighty Father of us all—the freeman and the slave—I poured forth the supplications of a broken spirit, imploring strength from on high to bear up against the burden of my troubles […].	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""family"", ""christianity""]"
5	1	He would make us hold up our heads, walk briskly back and forth, while customers would feel of our hands and arms and bodies, turn us about, ask us what we could do, make us open our mouths and show our teeth, precisely as a jockey examines a horse which he is about to barter for or purchase. 	"[""racism-and-slavery""]"
6	1	The influences and associations that had always surrounded him, blinded him to the inherent wrong at the bottom of the system of Slavery. He never doubted the moral right of one man holding another in subjection. Looking through the same medium with his fathers before him, he saw things in the same light. Brought up under other circumstances and influences, his notions would undoubtedly have been different.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""family""]"
7	1	He was my master, entitled by law to my flesh and blood, and to exercise over me such tyrannical control as his mean nature prompted; but there was no law that could prevent my looking upon him with intense contempt.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
8	1	I must toil day after day, endure abuse and taunts and scoffs, sleep on the hard ground, live on the coarsest fare, and not only this, but live the slave of a blood-seeking wretch, of whom I must stand henceforth in continued fear and dread. […] I sighed for liberty; but the bondman’s chain was round me, and could not be shaken off.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
9	1	Bent with excessive toil—actually suffering for a little refreshing rest, and feeling rather as if we could cast ourselves upon the earth and weep, many a night in the house of Edwin Epps have his unhappy slaves been made to dance and laugh. 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""the-power-of-music""]"
10	1	The existence of Slavery in its most cruel form among them has a tendency to brutalize the humane and finer feelings of their nature. Daily witnesses of human suffering—listening to the agonizing screeches of the human slave—beholding him writhing beneath the merciless lash—bitten and torn by dogs—dying without attention, and buried without shroud or coffin—it cannot otherwise be expected, than that they should become brutified and reckless of human life. 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
11	1	Alas! Had it not been for my beloved violin, I scarcely can conceive how I could have endured the long years of bondage. It […] relieved me of many days’ labor in the field […] and oftentimes led me away from the presence of a hard master. […] It was my companion—the friend of my bosom—triumphing loudly when I was joyful, and uttering its soft, melodious consolations when I was sad. Often […] it would sing me a song of peace.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""christianity"", ""the-power-of-music""]"
12	1	No man who has never been placed in such a situation, can comprehend the thousand obstacles thrown in the way of the flying slave. Every white man’s hand is raised against him—the patrollers are watching for him—the hounds are ready to follow on his track—and the nature of the country is such as renders it impossible to pass through it with any safety.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
13	1	It was the Sabbath of the Lord. The fields smiled in the warm sunlight—the birds chirped merrily amidst the foliage of the trees—peace and happiness seemed to reign everywhere, save in the bosoms of Epps and his panting victim and the silent witnesses around him. The tempestuous emotions that were raging there were little in harmony with the calm and quiet beauty of the day. I could look on Epps only with unutterable loathing and abhorrence, and thought within myself—“Thou devil, sooner or later, somewhere in the course of eternal justice, thou shalt answer for this sin!”	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
14	1	If they are baboons, or stand no higher in the scale of intelligence than such animals, you and men like you will have to answer for it. There’s a sin, a fearful sin, resting on this nation, that will not go unpunished forever. There will be a reckoning yet—yes, Epps, there’s a day coming that will burn as an oven. It may be sooner or it may be later, but it’s a coming as sure as the Lord is just. 	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
15	1	The secret was out—the mystery was unraveled. Through the thick, black cloud, amid whose dark and dismal shadows I had walked twelve years, broke the star that was to light me back to liberty.	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice"", ""christianity""]"
16	1	I was then offered as a witness, but, objection being made, the court decided my evidence inadmissible. It was rejected solely on the ground that I was a colored man—the fact of my being a free citizen of New-York not being disputed. […] Burch himself was offered as a witness in his own behalf. It was contended by counsel for the people, that such testimony should not be allowed—that it was in contravention of every rule of evidence, and if permitted would defeat the ends of justice. His testimony, however, was received by the court!	"[""racism-and-slavery"", ""truth-and-justice""]"
17	1	[King George III] had denounced the leaders of the uprising for having American independence as their true objective, something those leaders themselves had not yet openly declared.	"[""leadership"", ""idealism-vs-practicality"", ""colonial-society"", ""british-society""]"
18	1	"There had been sickness aplenty from the start, deadly ""camp fever,"" which grew worse as summer went on. Anxious mothers and wives from the surrounding towns and countryside came to nurse the sick and dying."	"[""idealism-vs-practicality"", ""colonial-society""]"
19	1	But for all his raw courage in the heat and tumult of war, Billy Howe could be, in the intervals between actions, slow-moving, procrastinating, negligent in preparing for action, interested more in his own creature comforts and pleasures.	"[""leadership"", ""british-society""]"
20	1	"Furthermore, as he knew, discipline was hardly improved, and too many of the new troops were raw recruits as unruly as those of the summer before. Some who were lauded as shining examples of patriotism looked hardly fit for battle, like the Connecticut unit comprised entirely of ""aged gentlemen."""	"[""military-strategy"", ""leadership"", ""idealism-vs-practicality""]"
21	1	Remember officers and soldiers that you are free men, fighting for the blessings of liberty- that slavery will be your portion, and that of your posterity, if you do not acquit yourselves like men.	"[""leadership"", ""idealism-vs-practicality""]"
22	1	There was no ringing call for valor in the cause of country or the blessings of liberty, as Washington had exhorted his troops at Brooklyn, only a final reminder of the effectiveness of bayonets.	"[""leadership"", ""idealism-vs-practicality""]"
23	1	"Possibly, Washington was more hurt than angry. Later he would tell Reed, ""I was hurt not because I thought my judgment wronged by the expressions contained in it [the letter], but because the same sentiments were not communicated immediately to myself."" Possibly the charge of ""fatal indecision of mind"" also hurt deeply, because Washington knew it to be true."	"[""leadership""]"
24	1	She's one of these cash-register-watchers, a witch about fifty with rouge on her cheekbones and no eyebrows, and I know it made her day to trip me up. She'd been watching cash registers forty years and probably never seen a mistake before.	"[""appearances-and-inner-lives""]"
25	1	My brain was drowning in grease. But that makes the whole thing sound weirdo and funny, like my brain was a giant French fry, so it seems more serious and poetic and accurate to say, “I was born with water on the brain.”	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""drawing-writing-and-junior-s-cartoons""]"
26	1	My parents came from poor people who came from poor people who came from poor people, all the way back to the very first poor people. Adam and Eve covered their privates with fig leaves; the first Indians covered their privates with their tiny hands.	"[""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism""]"
27	1	“It’s not like anybody’s going to notice if you go away,” he said. “So you might as well gut it out.”	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age""]"
28	1	After high school, my sister just froze. Didn’t go to college, didn’t get a job. Didn’t do anything. Kind of sad, I guess. But she is also beautiful and strong and funny. She is the prettiest and strongest and funniest person who ever spent twenty-three hours a day alone in a basement.	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""overlapping-opposites"", ""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism"", ""hope-dreams-and-loss""]"
29	1	“You’ve been fighting since you were born,” he said. “You fought off that brain surgery. You fought off those seizures. You fought off all the drunks and drug addicts. You kept your hope. And now, you have to take your hope and go somewhere where other people have hope.”	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism"", ""hope-dreams-and-loss""]"
30	1	“You always thought you were better than me,” he yelled. “No, no, I don’t think I’m better than anybody. I think I’m worse than everybody else.” “Why are you leaving?” “I have to go. I’m going to die if I don’t leave.”	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism"", ""hope-dreams-and-loss""]"
31	1	“My name is Junior,” I said. “And my name is Arnold. I’m Junior and Arnold. I’m both.” I felt like two different people inside of one body. No, I felt like a magician slicing myself in half, with Junior living on the north side of the Spokane River and Arnold living on the south.	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""overlapping-opposites""]"
32	1	“Hey buddy,” I would have said. “How do I make a beautiful white girl fall in love with me?” “Well, buddy,” he would have said. “The first thing you have to do is change the way you look, the way you talk, and the way you walk. And then she’ll think you’re her fricking Prince Charming.”	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""hope-dreams-and-loss""]"
33	1	There are all kinds of addicts, I guess. We all have pain. And we all look for ways to make the pain go away.	"[""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism""]"
34	1	Traveling between Reardan and Wellpinit, between the little white town and the reservation, I always felt like a stranger. I was half Indian in one place and half white in the other. It was like being Indian was my job, but it was only a part-time job. And it didn’t pay well at all.	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""overlapping-opposites""]"
35	1	I mean, the thing is, plenty of Indians have died because they were drunk. And plenty of drunken Indians have killed other drunken Indians. But my grandmother had never drunk alcohol in her life. Not one drop. That’s the rarest kind of Indian in the world.	"[""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism"", ""hope-dreams-and-loss""]"
36	1	Two thousand Indians laughed at the same time. … It was the most glorious noise I’d ever heard. And I realized that, sure, Indians were drunk and sad and displaced and crazy and mean, but dang, we knew how to laugh.  When it comes to death, we know that laughter and tears are pretty much the same thing.	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""overlapping-opposites"", ""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism"", ""hope-dreams-and-loss""]"
37	1	“I used to think the world was broken down by tribes,” I said. “By black and white. By Indian and white. But I know that isn’t true. The world is only broken into two tribes: The people who are assholes and the people who are not.”	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age""]"
38	1	We had defeated the enemy! We had defeated the champions! We were David who’d thrown a stone into the brain of Goliath! And then I realized something. I realized that my team, the Reardan Indians, was Goliath.	"[""overlapping-opposites"", ""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism"", ""confessions-revenge-and-forgiveness""]"
39	1	Gordy gave me this book by a Russian dude named Tolstoy, who wrote: “Happy families are all alike; every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way.” Well, I hate to argue with a Russian genius, but Tolstoy didn’t know Indians. And he didn’t know that all Indian families are unhappy for the same exact reason: the fricking booze.	"[""racism-poverty-and-alcoholism"", ""drawing-writing-and-junior-s-cartoons""]"
40	1	I realized that, sure, I was a Spokane Indian. I belonged to that tribe. But I also belonged to the tribe of American immigrants. And to the tribe of basketball players. And to the tribe of bookworms. And to the tribe of cartoonists. And to the tribe of chronic masturbators. And the tribe of teenage boys. And the tribe of small-town kids. And the tribe of Pacific Northwesterners. And the tribe of tortilla-chips-and-salsa lovers. And the tribe of poverty. And the tribe of funeral-goers. And the tribe of beloved sons. And the tribe of boys who really missed their best friends. It was a huge realization. And that’s when I knew that I was going to be okay.	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""overlapping-opposites"", ""hope-dreams-and-loss"", ""drawing-writing-and-junior-s-cartoons""]"
41	1	“You’re an old-time nomad,” Rowdy said. “You’re going to keep moving all over the world in search of food and water and grazing land. That’s pretty cool.”	"[""identity-belonging-and-coming-of-age"", ""confessions-revenge-and-forgiveness"", ""hope-dreams-and-loss""]"
42	1	SIDNEY: [chuckling knowingly] I don't imagine the wife of a banker will particularly choose to spend her evening in our kitchen. Smart as it is. 	"[""the-middle-class"", ""materialism"", ""gender-roles""]"
43	1	GEOFFREY: Yes, I know. You’re very anxious, aren't you, that I should go and work for the up and coming Mr. Hopcroft? So is up and coming Mr. Hopcroft.	"[""fortune""]"
44	1	RONALD: Drink? No, I don't honestly think so. She's always liked a—I mean, the doctor did say she should lay off. But that was only because it was acting as a stimulant—She hasn't touched it lately. 	"[""the-middle-class"", ""materialism"", ""gender-roles""]"
45	1	Crying adds something: crying is you, plus tears. But the feeling Colin had was some horrible opposite of crying. It was you, minus something.	"[""self-actualization"", ""romantic-love""]"
46	1	All I ever wanted was for her to love me and to do something meaningful with my life.	"[""achievement-and-mortality"", ""self-actualization"", ""storytelling"", ""plans-change-and-growth"", ""romantic-love""]"
47	1	Driving was a kind of thinking, the only kind he could then tolerate. But still the thought lurked out there, just beyond the reach of his headlights: he’d been dumped. By a girl named Katherine. For the nineteenth time.	"[""achievement-and-mortality"", ""storytelling"", ""romantic-love""]"
48	1	Shit, Colin made a funny. This place is like magic for you. Shame about how we’re gonna die here, though. I mean, seriously. An Arab and a half-Jew enter a store in Tennessee. It’s the beginning of a joke, and the punchline is “sodomy.”	"[""plans-change-and-growth""]"
49	1	[Y]ou can see into the future if you have a basic understanding of how people are likely to act.	"[""achievement-and-mortality"", ""storytelling"", ""plans-change-and-growth"", ""romantic-love""]"
50	1	Like it or not, Colin thought, road trips have destinations.	"[""achievement-and-mortality"", ""storytelling"", ""plans-change-and-growth""]"
51	1	Authors never included the whole story; they just got to the point. Colin thought the truth should matter as much as the point, and he figured that was why he couldn’t tell good stories.	"[""storytelling"", ""plans-change-and-growth""]"
52	1	The missing piece in his stomach hurt so much – and eventually he stopped thinking about the Theorem and wondered only how something that isn’t there can hurt you.	"[""self-actualization"", ""storytelling"", ""plans-change-and-growth"", ""romantic-love""]"
53	1	You’re not boring. You’ve got to stop saying that, or people will start believing you.	"[""storytelling"", ""plans-change-and-growth""]"
54	1	“It’s funny, what people will do to be remembered.”	"[""achievement-and-mortality"", ""self-actualization"", ""storytelling"", ""plans-change-and-growth""]"
55	1	As the staggered lines rushed past him, he thought about the space between what we remember and what happened, the space between what we predict and what will happen. And in that space, Colin thought, there was room enough to reinvent himself – room enough to make himself into something other than a prodigy, to remake his story better and different – room enough to be reborn again and again….There was room enough to be anyone – anyone except whom he’d already been, for if Colin had learned one thing from Gutshot, it’s that you can’t stop the future from coming. And for the first time in his life, he smiled thinking about the always-coming infinite future stretching out before him.	"[""achievement-and-mortality"", ""self-actualization"", ""storytelling"", ""plans-change-and-growth"", ""romantic-love""]"
56	1	…working as he did rather for the love of his art than for the acquirement of wealth, he refused to associate himself with any investigation which did not tend towards the unusual, and even the fantastic.	"[""fate-and-justice""]"
57	1	You don’t know about me, without you have read a book by the name of “The Adventures of Tom Sawyer,” but that ain’t no matter. That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain, and he told the truth, mainly. There was things which he stretched, but mainly he told the truth.	"[""society-and-hypocrisy"", ""freedom""]"
58	1	I went and told the Widow about it, and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was “spiritual gifts.” This was too much for me, but she told me what she means—I must help others, and do everything I could for other people, and look out for them all the time, and never think about myself…but I couldn’t see no advantage about it—except for the other people—so at last I reckoned I wouldn’t worry about it any more, but just let it go.	"[""society-and-hypocrisy"", ""religion-and-superstition"", ""growing-up""]"
59	1	“And looky here—you drop that school, you hear? I’ll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better’n what he is.”	"[""society-and-hypocrisy""]"
60	1	“When they told me there was a State in this country where they’d let that nigger vote, I drawed out. I says I’ll never vote again…I says to the people, why ain’t this nigger put up at auction and sold?”	"[""slavery-and-racism"", ""society-and-hypocrisy"", ""freedom""]"
61	1	“People will call me a low down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum—but that don’t make no difference. I ain’t agoing to tell, and I ain’t agoing back there anyways.”	"[""slavery-and-racism"", ""growing-up"", ""freedom""]"
62	1	“I’m unfavorable to killin’ a man as long as you can git around it; it ain’t good sense, it ain’t good morals.”	"[""society-and-hypocrisy""]"
63	1	I begun to think how dreadful it was, even for murderers, to be in such a fix. I says to myself, there ain’t no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself, yet, and then how would I like it?	"[""growing-up"", ""freedom""]"
64	1	Well, he [Jim] was right; he was most always right; he had an uncommon level head, for a nigger.	"[""slavery-and-racism"", ""growing-up""]"
65	1	“My heart wuz mos’ broke bekase you wuz los’, en I didn’t k’yer no mo’ what become er me en de raf’. En when I wake up en fine you back agin’, all safe en soun’, de tears come en I could a got down on my knees en kiss’ yo’ foot I’s so thankful. En all you wuz thinkin ‘bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie.”	"[""slavery-and-racism"", ""growing-up""]"
66	1	Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom. Well, I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish, too, to hear him, because I begun to get it through my head that he was most free—and who was to blame for it? Why, me. 	"[""slavery-and-racism"", ""society-and-hypocrisy"", ""growing-up"", ""freedom""]"
67	1	“Did you want to kill [the Shepherdson], Buck?” “Well, I bet I did.” “What did he do to you?” “Him? He never done nothing to me.” “Well, then, what did you want to kill him for?” “Why nothing—only it’s on account of the feud.”	"[""society-and-hypocrisy""]"
68	1	For what you want, above all things, on a raft, is for everybody to be satisfied, and feel right and kind towards others.	"[""society-and-hypocrisy"", ""freedom""]"
69	1	“I doan’ mine one er two kings, but dat’s enough. Dis one’s powerful drunk, en de duke ain’ much better.”	"[""society-and-hypocrisy""]"
70	1	“The pitifulest thing out is a mob; that’s what an army is—a mob; they don’t fight with courage that’s born in them, but with courage that’s borrowed from their mass, and from their officers. But a mob without any man at the head of it, is beneath pitifulness.”	"[""society-and-hypocrisy""]"
71	1	I do believe [Jim] cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their’n. It don’t seem natural, but I reckon it’s so.	"[""slavery-and-racism"", ""society-and-hypocrisy"", ""growing-up""]"
72	1	“All right, then, I’ll go to hell”—and [I] tore [my note to Miss Watson] up.	"[""slavery-and-racism"", ""growing-up"", ""freedom""]"
73	1	I’m bound to say Tom Sawyer fell, considerable, in my estimation. Only I couldn’t believe it. Tom Sawyer a nigger stealer!	"[""slavery-and-racism"", ""growing-up""]"
74	1	But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest, because Aunt Sally she’s going to adopt me and sivilize me and I can’t stand it. I been there before.	"[""society-and-hypocrisy"", ""freedom""]"
75	1	 But I hope 	"[""war-and-its-aftermath"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
76	1	The people’s voice, once angered, can create dissent, ratifying a curse which now must have its way.  And so, in my anxiety, I wait,  listening for something murky, something emerging from the gloom.  For gods aren’t blind to men who kill. In time, black agents of revenge, the Furies, wear down and bring to nothing the fortunes of a man who prospers in unjust ways. They wear him out, reverse his luck, and bring him at last among the dead. There’s no remedy. To boast too much of one’s success is dangerous—the high mountain peak is struck by Zeus’ lightning bolt. I’d choose wealth no one could envy. May I never be the sort of man who puts whole cities to the sword. Let me never see myself enslaved, my life in someone else’s power. 	"[""revenge"", ""war-and-its-aftermath"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
77	1	 Daughter of Leda, guardian of my home, your speech was, like my absence, far too long. Praise that’s due to us should come from others. Then it’s worthwhile. All those things you said— don’t puff me up with such female honours,  or grovel there before me babbling tributes, like some barbarian. Don’t invite envy to cross my path by strewing it with cloth. That’s how we honour gods, not human beings. For a mortal man to place his foot like this on rich embroidery is, in my view, not without some risk. So I’m telling you honour me as a man, not as a god. My fame proclaims itself. It does not need foot mats made out of such embroideries. Not even to think of doing something bad is god’s greatest gift. When a man’s life ends in great prosperity, only then can we declare that he’s a happy man. Thus, if I act, in every circumstance, as I ought to now, there’s nothing I need fear.	"[""war-and-its-aftermath"", ""gender-roles"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
78	1	 Up there on that roof there sits a chorus— it never leaves. They sing in harmony, but the song is harsh, predicting doom.  Drinking human blood has made them bold— they dance in celebration through the house. The family’s Furies cannot be dislodged.  Sitting in the home, they chant their song, the madness that began all this, each in turn cursing that man who defiled his brother’s bed. 	"[""revenge"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
79	1	 To rest unsatisfied amid great wealth is in the nature of all human beings. No one can point and order it away from princely homes by uttering the words “Dissatisfaction, enter here no more!”  Take Agamemnon. The powers in heaven permitted him to capture Priam’s town, to return home honoured by the gods. But now, if he must pay the penalty for blood which other men before him shed and die in retribution for the dead  he killed himself, what mortal human being who hears all this can boast he lives a life unscarred by fate? 	"[""revenge"", ""war-and-its-aftermath"", ""fate-and-the-gods""]"
80	1	...[A]n unalterable and unquestioned law of the musical world required that the German text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be translated into Italian for the clearer understanding of English-speaking audiences. This seemed as natural to Newland Archer as all the other conventions on which his life was molded: such as the duty of using two silver-backed brushes with his monogram in blue enamel to part his hair, and of never appearing in society without a flower (preferably a gardenia) in his buttonhole.	"[""the-rules-of-society""]"
81	1	“Living together? Well, why not? Who had the right to make her life over if she hadn’t? I’m sick of the hypocrisy that would bury alive a woman of her age if her husband prefers to live with harlots.”He stopped and turned away angrily to light his cigar. “Women ought to be free—as free as we are,” he declared, making a discovery of which he was too irritated to measure the terrific consequences.	"[""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
82	1	What could he and she really know of each other, since it was his duty, as a “decent” fellow, to conceal his past from her, and hers, as a marriageable girl, to have no past to conceal?... He reviewed his friends’ marriages... and saw none that answered, even remotely, to the passionate and tender comradeship which he pictured as his permanent relation with May Welland. He perceived that such a picture presupposed, on her part, the experience, the versatility, the freedom of judgment, which she had been carefully trained not to possess; and with a shiver of foreboding he saw his marriage becoming what most of the other marriages about him were: a dull association of material and social interests held together by ignorance on the one side and hypocrisy on the other.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
83	1	The Countess Olenska was the only young woman at the dinner; yet, as Archer scanned the smooth plump elderly faces between their diamond necklaces and towering ostrich feathers, they struck him as curiously immature compared with hers. It frightened him to think what must have gone to the making of her eyes.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society"", ""american-vs-foreign""]"
84	1	Does no one want to know the truth here, Mr. Archer? The real loneliness is living among all these kind people who only ask one to pretend!	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
85	1	“Sincerely, then—what should you gain that would compensate for the possibility—the certainty—of a lot of beastly talk?”“But my freedom—is that nothing?”... “But aren’t you free as air as it is?” he returned. “Who can touch you? Mr. Letterblair tells me the financial question has been settled—”“Oh, yes,” she said indifferently.“Well, then: is it worth while to risk what may be infinitely disagreeable and painful? Think of the newspapers—their vileness! It’s all stupid and narrow and unjust—but one can’t make over society.”	"[""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society"", ""change-and-progress""]"
86	1	No, it was worse a thousand times if, judging Beaufort, and probably despising him, she was yet drawn to him by all that gave him an advantage over the other men about her: his habit of two continents and two societies, his familiar association with artists and actors..., and his careless contempt for local prejudices.... [T]he circumstances of his life, and a certain native shrewdness, made him better worth talking to than many men, morally and socially his betters, whose horizon was bounded by the Battery and the Central Park. How should anyone coming from a wider world not feel the difference and be attracted by it?	"[""the-rules-of-society"", ""american-vs-foreign""]"
87	1	Traces still lingered on [her features] of fresh beauty like her daughter’s; and he asked himself if May’s face was doomed to thicken into the same middle-aged image of invincible innocence.Ah, no, he did not want May to have that kind of innocence, the innocence that seals the mind against imagination and the heart against experience!	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage""]"
88	1	I felt there was no one as kind as you; no one who gave me reasons that I understood for doing what at first seemed so hard and—unnecessary. The very good people didn’t convince me; I felt they’d never been tempted. But you knew; you understood; you had felt the world outside tugging at one with all its golden hands—and yet you hated the things it asks of one; you hated happiness bought by disloyalty and cruelty and indifference. That was what I’d never known before—and it’s better than anything I’ve known.... I can’t go back now to that other way of thinking. I can’t love you unless I give you up.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
89	1	A stormy discussion as to whether the wedding presents should be “shown” had darkened the last hours before the wedding; and it seemed inconceivable to Archer that grown-up people should work themselves into a state of agitation over such trifles.... Yet there was a time when Archer had had definite and rather aggressive opinions on all such problems, and when everything concerning the manners and customs of his little tribe had seemed to him fraught with worldwide significance.“And all the while, I suppose,” he thought, “real people were living somewhere, and real things happening to them...”	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
90	1	In all the rainy desert of autumnal London there were only two people whom the Newland Archers knew; and these two they had sedulously avoided, in conformity with the old New York tradition that it was not “dignified” to force oneself on the notice of one’s acquaintances in foreign countries.Mrs. Archer and Janey... had so unflinchingly lived up to this principle... that they had almost achieved the record of never having exchanged a word with a “foreigner” other than those employed in hotels and railway-stations.	"[""the-rules-of-society"", ""american-vs-foreign""]"
91	1	His whole future seemed suddenly to be unrolled before him; and passing down its endless emptiness he saw the dwindling figure of a man to whom nothing was ever to happen.... It had seemed so exactly the place in which he ought to have found Madame Olenska; and she was far away, and even the pink sunshade was not hers...	"[""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""change-and-progress""]"
92	1	“Is it a bad business—for May?”He stood in the window... feeling in every fiber the wistful tenderness with which she had spoken her cousin’s name.“For that’s the thing we’ve always got to think of—haven’t we—by your own showing?” she insisted.... “[I]f it’s not worth while to have given up, to have missed things, so that others may be saved from disillusionment and misery—then everything I came home for, everything that made my other life seem by contrast so bare and so poor because no one there took account of them—all these things are a sham or a dream—”	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
93	1	[P]unctually at about this time Mrs. Archer always said that New York was very much changed.Observing it from the lofty stand-point of a non-participant, she was able... to trace each new crack in its surface, and all the strange weeds pushing up between the ordered rows of social vegetables. It had been one of the amusements of Archer’s youth to... hear her enumerate the minute signs of disintegration that his careless gaze had overlooked. For New York, to Mrs. Archer’s mind, never changed without changing for the worse.... 	"[""the-rules-of-society"", ""change-and-progress""]"
94	1	As she sat thus, the lamplight full on her clear brow, he said to himself with a secret dismay that he would always know the thoughts behind it, that never, in all the years to come, would she surprise him by an unexpected mood, by a new idea, a weakness, a cruelty or an emotion.... Now she was simply ripening into a copy of her mother, and mysteriously, by the very process, trying to turn him into a Mr. Welland.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society"", ""change-and-progress""]"
95	1	And then it came over him, in a vast flash made up of many broken gleams, that to all of them he and Madame Olenska were lovers.... He guessed himself to have been, for months, the center of countless silently observing eyes and patiently listening ears, he understood that, by means as yet unknown to him, the separation between himself and the partner of his guilt had been achieved, and that now the whole tribe had rallied about his wife on the tacit assumption that nobody knew anything, or had ever imagined anything....It was the old New York way, of taking life “without effusion of blood”; the way of people who dreaded scandal more than disease, who placed decency above courage, and who considered that nothing was more ill-bred than “scenes,” except the behavior of those who gave rise to them.	"[""innocence-vs-experience"", ""the-failure-of-marriage"", ""the-rules-of-society""]"
96	1	And as he had seen her that day, so she had remained;... generous, faithful, unwearied; but so lacking in imagination, so incapable of growth, that the world of her youth had fallen into pieces and rebuilt itself without her ever being conscious of the change.... And she had died thinking the world a good place, full of loving and harmonious households like her own, and resigned to leave it because she was convinced that, whatever happened, Newland would continue to inculcate in Dallas the same principles and prejudices which had shaped his parents’ lives, and that Dallas in turn (when Newland followed her) would transmit the sacred trust to little Bill.

97	1	“I weep for Narcissus, but I never noticed that Narcissus was beautiful. I weep because, each time he knelt beside my banks, I could see, in the depths of his eyes, my own beauty reflected.” “What a lovely story,” the alchemist thought.	"[""alchemy-and-the-value-of-simplicity""]"

99	1	“Well, why don’t you go to Mecca now?” asked the boy. “Because it’s the thought of Mecca that keeps me alive. That’s what helps me face these days that are all the same, these mute crystals on the shelves, and lunch and dinner at that same horrible café. I’m afraid that if my dream is realized, I’ll have no reason to go on living.”	"[""the-pursuit-of-your-personal-legend"", ""the-unimportance-of-death-and-fear""]"
100	1	He thought of the many roads he had traveled, and of the strange way God had chosen to show him his treasure. If he hadn’t believed in the significance of recurrent dreams, he would not have met the Gypsy woman, the king, the thief, or…“Well, it’s a long list. But the path was written in the omens, and there was no way I could go wrong,” he said to himself.	"[""the-pursuit-of-your-personal-legend"", ""maktub-and-what-is-meant-to-be""]"
101	1	They are like birdcages; but what is being caged in? Legs, the legs of ladies; legs penned in so they cannot get out and go rubbing up against the gentlemen’s trousers. The Governor’s wife never says legs, although the newspapers said legs when they were talking about Nancy, with her dead legs sticking out from under the washtub.	"[""female-sexuality-and-the-nature-of-women"", ""social-class-and-propriety""]"
102	1	When I was quite young, six or seven, I put my hand on my mother’s belly, which was all round and tight, and I said What is in there, another mouth to feed, and my mother smiled sadly and said Yes I fear so, and I had a picture of an enormous mouth, on a head like the flying angel heads on the gravestones, but with teeth and all, eating away at my mother from the inside, and I began to cry because I thought it would kill her.	"[""female-sexuality-and-the-nature-of-women"", ""gender-ownership-and-power""]"
103	1	It would be helpful to me, if she were indeed mad, or at least a little madder than she appears to be; but thus far she has manifested a composure that a duchess might envy. I have never known any woman to be so thoroughly self-contained.	"[""female-sexuality-and-the-nature-of-women"", ""social-class-and-propriety"", ""truth-memory-and-madness""]"
104	1	And since that time I have thought, why is it that women have chosen to sew such flags, and then to lay them on the tops of beds? For they make the bed the most noticeable thing in a room. And then I have thought, it’s for a warning. Because you may think a bed is a peaceful thing, Sir, and to you it may mean rest and comfort and a good night’s sleep. But it isn’t so for everyone; and there are many dangerous things that may take place in a bed. It is where we are born, and that is our first peril in life; and it is where the women give birth, which is often their last. And it is where the act takes place between men and women […] and some call it love, and others despair, or else merely an indignity which they must suffer through. 	"[""female-sexuality-and-the-nature-of-women"", ""gender-ownership-and-power""]"
105	1	There were red smears afterwards, on his shirt, from where she’d started to undo his buttons; but it was the first time he’d ever kissed a woman, and he’d been embarrassed, and then alarmed, and hadn’t known what to do next. Probably she’d laughed at him.	"[""female-sexuality-and-the-nature-of-women"", ""social-class-and-propriety"", ""gender-ownership-and-power""]"
106	1	[…] and one day they did see a bear, and Nancy ran away screaming, and climbed a tree. Sally said the bear was more frightened than Nancy was, and Nancy said it was probably a gentleman bear and it was running away from something dangerous that it had never seen before, but might have caught a glimpse of as she climbed the tree; and they laughed very much.

107	1	What was in there for wiping was an old copy of the Godey’s Ladies’ Book; I always looked at the pictures before using them. Most were of the latest fashions, but some were of duchesses from England and high-society ladies in New York and the like. You should never let your picture be in a magazine or newspaper if you can help it, as you never know what ends your face may be made to serve, by others, once it has got out of your control.

108	1	And they do say that cleanliness is next to Godliness; and sometimes, when I have seen the pure white clouds billowing in the sky after a rain, I used to think that it was as if the angels themselves were hanging out their washing; for I reasoned that someone must do it, as everything in Heaven must be very clean and fresh.	"[""social-class-and-propriety"", ""justice-and-religion""]"
109	1	In fact I have no idea of what kind of a sunrise there was. In prison they make the windows high up, so you cannot climb out of them I suppose, but also so you cannot see out of them either, or at least not onto the outside world. They do not want you looking out, they do not want you thinking the word out, they do not want you looking at the horizon and thinking you might someday drop below it yourself, like the sail of a ship departing or a horse and rider vanishing down a far hillside.	"[""storytelling-and-power""]"
110	1	Then I say, I thank you from the bottom of my heart, Sir, this radish was like the nectar of the Gods. He looks surprised to hear me use such an expression; but that’s only because he doesn’t remember that I have read the poetry of Sir Walter Scott.	"[""storytelling-and-power"", ""social-class-and-propriety""]"
111	1	Underneath her stiff dress there must be breasts, not starched and corset-shaped, but made of soft flesh, with nipples; he finds himself idly guessing what colour these nipples would be, in sunlight or else in lamplight, and how large. Nipples pink and small like the snouts of animals, of rabbits or mice perhaps; or the almost-red of ripening currants; or the scaly brown of acorn caps. His imagination runs, he notes, to wildwood details, and to things hard or alert.	"[""gender-ownership-and-power""]"
112	1	It’s dark as a stone in this room, and hot as a roasting heart; if you stare into the darkness with your eyes open you are sure to see something after a time. I hope it will not be flowers. But this is the time they like to grow, the red flowers, the shining red peonies which are like satin, which are like splashes of paint. The soil for them is emptiness, it is empty space and silence. I whisper, Talk to me; because I would rather have talking than the slow gardening that takes place in silence, with the red satin petals dripping down the wall.

113	1	Grace continues her stitching. She does not look up. “Nobody has cared about that before, Sir,” she says. “They told me I must be lying; they kept wanting to know more. Except for Mr. Kenneth MacKenzie the lawyer. But I am sure that even he did not believe me.”	"[""storytelling-and-power"", ""truth-memory-and-madness""]"
114	1	I said, What do you want here, but he did not answer, he just kept on being silver, so I went out to milk the cow; because the only thing to do about God is to go on with what you were doing anyway, since you can’t ever stop him or get any reasons out of him. There is a Do this or a Do that with God, but not any Because.	"[""social-class-and-propriety"", ""truth-memory-and-madness"", ""justice-and-religion""]"
115	1	But he’ll pry it out of her yet. He’s got the hook in her mouth, but can he pull her out? Up, out of the abyss, up to the light. Out of the deep blue sea.	"[""female-sexuality-and-the-nature-of-women"", ""truth-memory-and-madness"", ""gender-ownership-and-power""]"
116	1	Then I put on a clean apron, and stirred up the fire in the summer kitchen stove, which still had some embers left in it, and burnt my own clothes; I didn’t like the thought of wearing them ever again, as they would remind me of things I wished to forget. It may have been my fancy, but a smell went up from them like scorching meat; and it was like my own dirtied and cast-off skin that was burning.	"[""truth-memory-and-madness""]"
117	1	I was horrified, and asked how could he do such a thing; and he said what did I mean, as I was wearing Nancy’s dress and bonnet myself. And I said it was not the same thing, and he said it was; and I said at least I had not taken the boots off a corpse.	"[""social-class-and-propriety"", ""truth-memory-and-madness"", ""justice-and-religion""]"
118	1	He wanted me to tell my story in what he called a coherent way, but would often accuse me of wandering, and become annoyed with me; and at last he said that the right thing was, not to tell the story as I truly remembered it, which nobody could be expected to make any sense of; but to tell a story that would hang together, and that had some chance of being believed.	"[""storytelling-and-power""]"
119	1	During the day, Rachel is a burden, an encumbrance, and he wishes to be rid of her; but at night she’s an altogether different person, and so is he. He too says no when he means yes. He means more, he means further, he means deeper. He would like to make an incision in her—just a small one—so he can taste her blood, which in the shadowy darkness of the bedroom seems to him like a normal wish to have.	"[""female-sexuality-and-the-nature-of-women"", ""gender-ownership-and-power""]"
120	1	I hope I was named after it. I would like to be found. I would like to see. Or to be seen. I wonder if, in the eye of God, it amounts to the same thing. As it says in the Bible, For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face.	"[""justice-and-religion""]"
121	1	Then there are his own requirements. There is passion in Grace somewhere, he’s certain of it, although it would take some hunting for. And she’d be grateful to him, albeit reluctantly. Gratitude by itself does not enthral [sic] him, but he likes the idea of reluctance.	"[""gender-ownership-and-power""]"
122	1	“You killed her,” breathes Lydia. “I always thought so.” She sounds, if anything, admiring.	"[""female-sexuality-and-the-nature-of-women"", ""truth-memory-and-madness"", ""justice-and-religion""]"
123	1	He’ll begin to tiptoe up the stairs, intending to avoid her. Then he’ll turn around, make his way to her room, shake her roughly awake. Tonight he’ll hit her, as she’s begged him to; he’s never done that before, it’s something new. He wants to punish her for his own addiction to her. He wants to make her cry; though not too loudly, or Dora will hear them, and trumpet scandal.	"[""social-class-and-propriety"", ""truth-memory-and-madness"", ""gender-ownership-and-power""]"
124	1	The room was so large it was almost frightening to me, and I pulled the sheet up over my head to make it darker; and then I felt as if my face was dissolving and turning into someone else’s face, and I recalled my poor mother in her shroud, as they were sliding her into the sea, and how I thought that she had already changed inside the sheet, and was a different woman, and now the same thing was happening to me. Of course I wasn’t dying, but it was in a way similar.	"[""storytelling-and-power"", ""truth-memory-and-madness"", ""justice-and-religion""]"
125	1	But three of the triangles in my Tree will be different. One will be white, from the petticoat I still have that was Mary Whitney’s; one will be faded yellowish, from the prison nightdress I begged as a keepsake when I left there. And the third will be a pale cotton, a pink and white floral, cut from the dress of Nancy’s that she had on the first day I was at Mr. Kinnear’s, and that I wore on the ferry to Lewiston, when I was running away.
